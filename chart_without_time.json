      "innate_talents": "Your Aquarius Sun excels in roles that fuse innovation with community uplift. Professionally, you might thrive as a social entrepreneur launching eco-tech startups, a data scientist mapping solutions for urban inequality, or a community organizer reimagining public spaces for accessibility. In daily life, you're the friend who rallies neighbors to convert vacant lots into urban gardens, hosts brainstorming sessions to solve local issues, or invents a DIY recycling system that goes viral. Your ability to think outside the box turns obstacles into opportunities\u2014whether redesigning a nonprofit's outreach strategy or teaching kids coding through gamified lessons.",

For example, you might draft a groundbreaking proposal for workplace equity but struggle to address a teammate's burnout, or prioritize futuristic goals over a partner's need for present-day connection. Your objectivity might also come across as detached during heartfelt conversations.\nTip: Balance vision with grounding. Before finalizing a project, ask, \"What's one small step I can take today to make this real?\" For interpersonal moments, practice empathy by saying, \"I hear you\u2014how can I support you right now?\"",

When feeling stuck, diving into a podcast, book club, or lively debate can reignite your sense of clarity and hope.",
      "emotional_challenges": "Growth Areas: Overthinking emotions or avoiding vulnerability by staying \"in your head\" can create distance from deeper needs. For instance, you might intellectualize sadness (\"Why shouldn't I feel this way?\") instead of letting yourself simply feel. Tip: Set a 5-minute timer daily to sit quietly and observe emotions without analysis\u2014imagine them as clouds passing through your mind's sky.",

In self-care, you recharge by engaging in eclectic hobbies, hosting themed gatherings, or curating a wardrobe that defies trends.",
      "challenges_to_refine": "Emotional detachment might surface as prioritizing ideas over intimacy. You could deflect a partner's vulnerability with humor or logic. Tip: Practice saying, \"I'm here\u2014let's explore this feeling together,\" to deepen connection.",
