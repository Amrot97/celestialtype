- **Growth Heading**: "Growth Areas:"
- **Growth Text**:"Your desire to be admired can lead to overextending yourself for applause. For example, you might take on a solo project at work to ensure you get sole credit, or dismiss a friend's event-planning ideas to maintain control. Your love for grandeur might also make routine tasks feel stifling, like skipping budgeting steps for a creative venture or rushing through a partner's heartfelt conversation to chase the next thrill.\nTip: Practice collaborative leadership. Before claiming the spotlight, ask, \"Who can I elevate here?\" Celebrate others' contributions openly to deepen loyalty without dimming your light.

- **Challenges Heading**: "Emotional Challenges:"
