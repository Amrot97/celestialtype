      "innate_talents": "Your Aquarius Sun excels in roles that fuse innovation with community uplift. Professionally, you might thrive as a social entrepreneur launching eco-tech startups, a data scientist mapping solutions for urban inequality, or a community organizer reimagining public spaces for accessibility. In daily life, you're the friend who rallies neighbors to convert vacant lots into urban gardens, hosts brainstorming sessions to solve local issues, or invents a DIY recycling system that goes viral. Your ability to think outside the box turns obstacles into opportunities\u2014whether redesigning a nonprofit's outreach strategy or teaching kids coding through gamified lessons.",
      "growth_areas": "Your focus on big-picture ideals can sometimes overlook practical details or emotional nuances. For example, you might draft a groundbreaking proposal for workplace equity but struggle to address a teammate's burnout, or prioritize futuristic goals over a partner's need for present-day connection. Your objectivity might also come across as detached during heartfelt conversations.\nTip: Balance vision with grounding. Before finalizing a project, ask, \"What's one small step I can take today to make this real?\" For interpersonal moments, practice empathy by saying, \"I hear you\u2014how can I support you right now?\"",

Your knack for uniting technology and humanity will turn abstract ideas into actionable movements.",

Your loyalty and ability to \"hold space\" make loved ones feel seen and cherished.

When overwhelmed, retreating to a cozy space with soft lighting or revisiting nostalgic music can restore your sense of calm.",
      "emotional_challenges": "Growth Areas: Sensitivity can lead to absorbing others' moods or guarding your heart too fiercely.
