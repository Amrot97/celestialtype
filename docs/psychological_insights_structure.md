# Psychological Insights Structure

This document details the structure for psychological insights generated by the CelestialType API, focusing on the specific format for different types of planets.

## Overview

The `psychologicalInsights` array in the API response contains detailed interpretations for each planet in its sign. The structure varies slightly depending on the type of planet:

1. **Personal Planets**: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars
2. **Social Planets**: Jupiter, Saturn
3. **Generational Planets**: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto

## Common Structure

All planet insights share this common structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Planet in Sign",
  "subtitle": "Descriptive subtitle",
  "planet": "PlanetName",
  "sign": "SignName",
  "traits": "Comma-separated list of traits",
  "explanation": "General explanation of the placement"

## Implementation Notes

1. **Content Customization**
   - All descriptions should be tailored to the specific planet-sign combination
   - Language should be positive, empowering, and action-oriented
   - Descriptions should be concise but meaningful (100-200 words per section)

2. **Sign and Element Context**
   - Insights should incorporate sign qualities, element, and modality
   - References to how this placement interacts with overall chart patterns

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Each insight object should be around 1-2KB in size
   - The complete array typically contains 10-12 planet insights

## Example Implementation

This is how you might generate a psychological insight for a planet:

```python
def generate_planet_insight(planet_name, sign_name, house_number=None):
    """Generate a psychological insight for a planet in a sign."""
    
    # Base structure for all planets
    insight = {
        "title": f"{planet_name} in {sign_name}",
        "planet": planet_name,
        "sign": sign_name,
        "traits": get_traits_for_planet_sign(planet_name, sign_name),
        "explanation": get_explanation_for_planet_sign(planet_name, sign_name)
    }
    
    # Add house information if available
    if house_number:
        insight["house"] = house_number
    
    # Add planet-specific fields based on planet type
    if planet_name == "Sun":
        insight["subtitle"] = "Your Core Identity & Purpose"
        insight["innate_talents"] = get_sun_talents(sign_name)
        insight["growth_areas"] = get_sun_growth_areas(sign_name)
        insight["personal_growth"] = get_sun_personal_growth(sign_name)
        insight["closing_affirmation"] = get_sun_affirmation(sign_name)
    
    elif planet_name == "Moon":
        insight["subtitle"] = "Your Emotional Landscape"
        insight["emotional_strengths"] = get_moon_strengths(sign_name)
        insight["emotional_challenges"] = get_moon_challenges(sign_name)
        insight["actionable_emotional_care"] = get_moon_self_care(sign_name)
        insight["closing_affirmation"] = get_moon_affirmation(sign_name)
    
    # Similar conditionals for other planets...
    
    return insight
```

## Storage Strategy

Planet descriptions should be stored in dedicated files for maintenance and organization:

1. **File per Planet**
   - `sun_sign_descriptions.py`
   - `moon_sign_descriptions.py`
   - etc.

2. **Dictionary Structure**
   ```python
   SUN_DESCRIPTIONS = {
       "Aries": {
           "traits": "Bold, pioneering, confident, direct, energetic",
           "explanation": "With Sun in Aries, your core identity...",
           "innate_talents": "You naturally excel at...",
           # etc.
       },
       "Taurus": {
           # Taurus descriptions
       },
       # More signs...
   }
   ```

3. **Accessing Descriptions**
   ```python
   def get_sun_sign_description(sign_name):
       """Get complete Sun description for a sign."""
       if sign_name in SUN_DESCRIPTIONS:
           return SUN_DESCRIPTIONS[sign_name]
       return None
   ```
