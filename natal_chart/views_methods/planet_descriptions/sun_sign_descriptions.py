SUN_SIGN_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "Aries": {
        "traits": "Bold, Trailblazing, Energetic, Passionate",
        "explanation": "Aries Suns are the pioneers of the zodiac. Their fearless drive and infectious enthusiasm propel them to initiate change, lead with conviction, and embrace challenges head-on. Guided by an innate sense of adventure, they thrive in dynamic environments where their passion and competitive spirit can ignite progress.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Aries Sun excels in roles demanding courage and initiative. Professionally, you might thrive as an entrepreneur launching a sustainable fashion brand, a coach inspiring athletes to break personal records, or an emergency responder leading high-stakes situations. In daily life, you're the friend who organizes spontaneous road trips, motivates your team to win a trivia night, or fearlessly negotiates a better deal on a car purchase. Your decisiveness also makes you a natural problem-solver—whether rallying coworkers during a project crunch or fixing a friend's flat tire in record time.",
        "growth_areas": "Your impulsiveness, while rooted in passion, can lead to rushing into projects without planning or reacting harshly when progress stalls. For example, you might start three hobbies at once only to abandon them, or snap at a colleague who misses a deadline.\nTip: Channel your energy strategically. Before diving into a new goal, ask, \"What's one actionable step I can take today?\" Pair this with mindfulness practices—like counting to five before responding to frustration—to balance spontaneity with reflection.",
        "personal_growth": "Create \"micro-challenges\" to cultivate patience. For instance, try a week of slow, intentional meals instead of eating on-the-go, or commit to finishing a puzzle before starting a new one. These small acts train your focus without dulling your spark.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Partner with Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to ground your ideas. Launch a fitness app with a Taurus (they'll handle budgeting while you design high-energy workouts), or mentor interns at work—your drive will inspire them, while their fresh perspectives keep you adaptable.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your courage isn't just a trait—it's a force that reshapes boundaries and inspires others to leap into action. Your passion isn't reckless; it's the spark that turns \"impossible\" into \"I'll make it happen.\" Lead boldly, pause purposefully, and remember: the world needs your fire to stay unstoppable."
    },
    
    "Taurus": {
        "traits": "Reliable, Patient, Grounded, Determined",
        "explanation": "Taurus Suns are the architects of the zodiac. Their steadfast reliability and patient determination empower them to build enduring foundations in careers, relationships, and personal aspirations. With a deep appreciation for beauty and comfort, they infuse everyday life with warmth and stability, turning ordinary moments into something extraordinary.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Taurus Sun thrives in roles that demand practicality and persistence. Professionally, you might excel as a financial planner crafting secure futures, a landscape designer creating serene outdoor spaces, or a chef blending flavors into comforting masterpieces. In daily life, you're the friend who organizes dependable dinner gatherings, negotiates a fair deal on a home renovation, or transforms a bare room into a cozy sanctuary with thrifted finds. Your determination ensures you see projects through—whether mastering a new skill or revitalizing a community garden—making you a trusted pillar in any team.",
        "growth_areas": "Your commitment to stability can sometimes lead to resisting change, even when it's necessary. For example, you might cling to an outdated workflow at work despite new efficiencies, or avoid updating a healthy routine because \"it's always worked before.\"\nTip: Embrace incremental shifts. Before dismissing a new idea, ask, \"What's one small way I can test this?\" Pair this with mindfulness—like a daily 3-minute breathing exercise—to ease anxiety around uncertainty.",
        "personal_growth": "Practice \"flexibility rituals.\" Try a new recipe weekly, take a different route to work, or explore a hobby outside your comfort zone (e.g., improv classes). These acts nurture adaptability while honoring your love for routine. Partner with Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) to merge innovation with your practicality. Co-host a workshop with a Libra—they'll brainstorm creative themes while you handle logistics—or design a sustainable product line with an Aquarius, blending their futurism with your eye for timeless quality.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your patience isn't passive—it's the quiet strength that turns dreams into reality. Your love for beauty isn't frivolous; it's a gift that makes the world feel like home. Build with purpose, adapt with grace, and remember: your steady hands shape lasting legacies."
    },
    
    "Gemini": {
        "traits": "Curious, Adaptable, Communicative, Witty",
        "explanation": "Gemini Suns are the storytellers of the zodiac. Their insatiable curiosity and quick-witted charm drive them to explore ideas, connect diverse perspectives, and breathe life into conversations. Guided by a love for learning, they thrive in ever-changing environments where their mental agility and social spark can shine.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Gemini Sun excels in roles demanding creativity and communication. Professionally, you might thrive as a journalist uncovering untold stories, a marketing strategist crafting viral campaigns, or a teacher designing interactive lessons. In daily life, you're the friend who hosts trivia nights, mediates debates with humor, or effortlessly chats up strangers at a party. Your adaptability makes you a master multitasker—whether juggling freelance projects, learning a new language, or planning a last-minute weekend getaway for friends.",
        "growth_areas": "Your restless mind can scatter focus, leading to unfinished projects or impulsive decisions. For example, you might start a podcast, a coding course, and a baking venture in one month, only to lose steam, or agree to too many social plans and cancel last-minute.\nTip: Anchor your energy with intention. Before committing to a new idea, ask, \"Does this align with my current priorities?\" Use tools like time-blocking or a \"focus playlist\" to stay on track without stifling your spontaneity.",
        "personal_growth": "Practice \"mindful curiosity.\" Dedicate 10 minutes daily to a single activity—like journaling, sketching, or a mindful walk—without distractions. This balances your love for stimulation with moments of depth.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Partner with Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to turn ideas into results. Launch a podcast with a Virgo co-host (they'll handle editing while you brainstorm topics), or collaborate with a Capricorn on a workshop series blending your dynamic delivery with their structured expertise.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your curiosity isn't just a trait—it's a bridge that connects people, ideas, and possibilities. Your wit isn't fleeting; it's the spark that turns ordinary moments into unforgettable stories.

    },
    
    "Cancer": {
        "traits": "Nurturing, Intuitive, Loyal, Imaginative",
        "explanation": "Cancer Suns are the heartkeepers of the zodiac. Their deep empathy and intuitive nature allow them to create safe, nurturing spaces where others feel seen and supported. Guided by emotional intelligence, they weave loyalty and creativity into every relationship and project, turning ordinary moments into meaningful rituals.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Cancer Sun thrives in roles that blend care with strategic thinking. Professionally, you might excel as a therapist attuned to clients' unspoken needs, a community organizer fostering inclusive events, or a chef crafting meals that evoke nostalgia and comfort. In daily life, you're the friend who remembers everyone's favorite dessert, transforms a bare-walled apartment into a cozy sanctuary, or senses when a loved one needs a check-in call. Your resourcefulness shines in crises—whether soothing a friend after a breakup or rallying neighbors to support a local family in need.",
        "growth_areas": "Your emotional depth can lead to absorbing others' moods or clinging to familiarity, even when growth requires change. For example, you might stay in a job that no longer fulfills you because it feels \"safe,\" or suppress your own needs to avoid \"rocking the boat\" in a friendship.\nTip: Protect your energy with gentle boundaries. Before taking on someone else's emotional load, ask, \"Is this mine to carry?\" Pair this with small acts of courage—like trying a new hobby solo—to build confidence in uncertainty.",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) to balance intuition with objectivity. Co-host a podcast with a Libra—they'll structure conversations while you infuse depth—or join a book club with an Aquarius to explore futuristic themes that stretch your imaginative roots.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Launch a project that merges care with innovation, like a subscription box for self-care rituals or a workshop series teaching emotional resilience through art. Your ability to anticipate needs will ensure it resonates deeply.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your nurturing isn't just kindness—it's a quiet revolution that heals fractured hearts. Your intuition isn't overthinking; it's a compass guiding you to build legacies of love. Protect your light, embrace growth gently, and remember: the world needs your tenderness to stay soft, brave, and whole."
    },

        "traits": "Confident, Charismatic, Passionate, Generous",
        "explanation": "Leo Suns are the luminaries of the zodiac. Their radiant confidence and magnetic charisma inspire others to embrace their authenticity and pursue bold goals. Guided by a fiery passion for self-expression, they infuse life with drama, warmth, and loyalty, turning every challenge into a stage for growth.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Leo Sun thrives in roles that demand vision and motivation. Professionally, you might excel as a theater director rallying a cast to deliver a show-stopping performance, a CEO championing employee empowerment through mentorship programs, or a coach helping athletes break mental barriers. In daily life, you're the friend who plans epic birthday surprises (think renting a food truck for a backyard party), uplifts a discouraged colleague with a heartfelt pep talk, or turns a dull team meeting into an engaging brainstorm with your infectious energy. Your generosity shines when mentoring newcomers at work or organizing a neighborhood talent show to spotlight hidden skills.",
        "growth_areas": "Your desire to be admired can lead to overextending yourself for applause. For example, you might take on a solo project at work to ensure you get sole credit, or dismiss a friend's event-planning ideas to maintain control. Your love for grandeur might also make routine tasks feel stifling, like skipping budgeting steps for a creative venture or rushing through a partner's heartfelt conversation to chase the next thrill.\nTip: Practice collaborative leadership. Before claiming the spotlight, ask, \"Who can I elevate here?\" Celebrate others' contributions openly to deepen loyalty without dimming your light. For routines, keep a \"spark journal\" noting small wins, like a slow-cooked meal that wowed guests or a gradual fitness milestone.",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) to balance passion with emotional depth. Co-create a storytelling night with a Pisces—they'll handle poetic themes while you mastermind the production—to merge heart and fire.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Launch a platform showcasing others' talents, like a podcast interviewing unsung heroes in your field or a workshop series where participants teach skills. Your leadership will shine by empowering others.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your confidence isn't arrogance—it's the courage to remind others they, too, can shine. Your passion isn't fleeting; it's the spark that turns dreams into legacies. Lead with heart, share the stage freely, and remember: the world needs your fire to stay bold, warm, and unapologetically alive."
    },
    
    "Virgo": {
        "traits": "Analytical, Practical, Detail-Oriented, Service-Oriented",
        "explanation": "Virgo Suns are the problem-solvers of the zodiac. Their sharp analytical mind and dedication to precision empower them to refine systems, improve processes, and uplift others through practical support. Guided by a desire to be useful, they thrive in roles where their attention to detail and quiet competence create tangible, lasting impact.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Virgo Sun excels in roles that demand precision and problem-solving. Professionally, you might thrive as a data analyst uncovering insights to streamline operations, an editor polishing manuscripts with flawless grammar, or a healthcare worker organizing patient care plans. In daily life, you're the friend who troubleshoots a glitchy app in minutes, creates a color-coded meal-prep system for a busy parent, or quietly fixes a neighbor's leaky faucet before they even ask. Your reliability makes you the go-to person in crises—whether reorganizing a chaotic workspace or proofreading a friend's resume before a big job interview.",
        "growth_areas": "Your pursuit of perfection can lead to overthinking or self-criticism. For example, you might delay launching a project because \"it's not flawless yet,\" or fixate on a minor typo in an otherwise stellar report. You could also neglect self-care while tending to others' needs, like skipping meals to finalize a community fundraiser plan.\nTip: Embrace \"good enough\" as progress. Before revising a task for the fifth time, ask, \"Does this meet the goal?\" Pair this with daily self-compassion rituals—like a 2-minute morning mantra (\"I am capable, not flawless\")—to soften inner criticism.",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Fire signs (Leo, Sagittarius, Aries) to balance practicality with spontaneity. For instance, team up with a Sagittarius friend to plan a trip—they'll brainstorm adventurous ideas while you map out efficient itineraries. Their boldness will remind you to enjoy the journey, not just the plan.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Create a resource that simplifies complexity for others, like a YouTube series demystifying tax filing for freelancers or a template library for small businesses. Your knack for clarity will turn overwhelm into actionable steps.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your precision isn't nitpicking—it's the quiet power that turns chaos into order. Your service isn't small; it's the foundation that helps others rise. Refine with purpose, embrace imperfection gently, and remember: the world needs your diligence to stay grounded, kind, and ever-evolving."
    },
    
    "Libra": {
        "traits": "Diplomatic, Harmonious, Social, Fair-Minded",
        "explanation": "Libra Suns are the peacemakers of the zodiac. Their innate sense of balance and diplomacy drives them to foster fairness, beauty, and connection in every interaction. Guided by a desire for harmony, they excel at mediating conflicts and creating environments where collaboration and mutual respect thrive.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Libra Sun shines in roles that require negotiation and aesthetic sensibility. Professionally, you might excel as a human resources specialist resolving workplace disputes, an interior designer crafting spaces that inspire calm, or a lawyer advocating for equitable solutions. In daily life, you're the friend who smooths over group tensions during a heated debate, plans a dinner party where every guest feels included, or curates a playlist that perfectly matches the vibe of a road trip. Your ability to see multiple perspectives makes you a trusted advisor—whether helping a sibling choose a college or guiding a colleague through a career crossroads.",
        "growth_areas": "Your aversion to conflict can lead to indecision or people-pleasing. For example, you might agonize for days over choosing a paint color for your home to avoid \"disrupting the vibe,\" or agree to a friend's plan despite personal reservations to keep the peace. Overcommitment to fairness might also cause you to overexplain simple choices, like justifying why you picked one café over another.\nTip: Embrace \"good enough\" decisions. Set a 5-minute timer for low-stakes choices (e.g., weekend plans) and stick to your first instinct. For tough conversations, practice assertive phrasing like, \"I value our bond, but I need to share my perspective.\"",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) to balance harmony with decisive action. Co-organize a project with an Aries—they'll push for bold moves while you ensure everyone's voice is heard—to blend spontaneity with inclusivity.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Launch a platform that bridges divides, like a podcast discussing ethical dilemmas in modern culture or a workshop teaching conflict resolution through art. Your gift for fairness will turn polarized topics into constructive dialogues.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your diplomacy isn't indecision—it's the art of weaving unity from diversity. Your love for beauty isn't superficial; it's a force that makes the world feel more humane. Champion balance, embrace courageous choices, and remember: the world needs your grace to stay just, kind, and beautifully interconnected."
    },
    
    "Scorpio": {

        "explanation": "Scorpio Suns are the alchemists of the zodiac. Their profound intuition and relentless drive empower them to uncover hidden truths, navigate crises, and inspire profound change. Guided by depth and determination, they thrive in challenges, turning adversity into fuel for personal and collective evolution.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Scorpio Sun excels in roles demanding insight and tenacity. Professionally, you might thrive as a forensic psychologist decoding human behavior, a crisis negotiator de-escalating high-stakes conflicts, or a researcher pioneering medical breakthroughs. In daily life, you're the friend who senses unspoken tensions in a group and addresses them with care, organizes a support network for a struggling coworker, or fearlessly advocates for marginalized voices. Your resilience shines in rebuilding—whether revitalizing a failing project at work or helping a loved one reclaim confidence after a setback.",
        "growth_areas": "Your intensity can sometimes manifest as distrust or emotional guardedness. For example, you might assume a colleague's feedback is secretly hostile, or withhold vulnerability in relationships to avoid perceived weakness. Your focus on control might also lead to burnout, like working late nights to micromanage a team project.\nTip: Practice \"strategic openness.\" Before assuming hidden motives, ask, \"What evidence supports this?\" For emotional walls, try small acts of vulnerability—like sharing a personal challenge with a trusted friend—to build trust without sacrificing boundaries.",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) to balance depth with perspective. Collaborate with a Libra on a mediation workshop—they'll teach diplomatic communication while you share strategies for emotional resilience.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Launch a platform that empowers through storytelling, like a podcast interviewing survivors of adversity or a newsletter dissecting societal systems with a critical lens. Your ability to tackle taboo topics will spark meaningful dialogue.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your intensity isn't intimidation—it's the force that unearths buried potential. Your resilience isn't stubbornness; it's the proof that even the deepest wounds can birth strength. Lead with curiosity, embrace vulnerability as power, and remember: the world needs your transformative fire to stay honest, courageous, and alive."
    },
    
    "Sagittarius": {
        "traits": "Adventurous, Optimistic, Philosophical, Freedom-Loving",

Their boundless optimism and thirst for knowledge drive them to seek truth, embrace diverse cultures, and inspire others through their adventurous spirit. Guided by a love for freedom, they thrive in environments that encourage growth, discovery, and the pursuit of meaning.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Sagittarius Sun excels in roles that blend exploration with education. Professionally, you might thrive as a travel journalist documenting untold global stories, a philosophy professor challenging students to question societal norms, or a life coach empowering others to break free from self-imposed limitations. In daily life, you're the friend who organizes spontaneous camping trips, initiates late-night debates about the universe's mysteries, or motivates a coworker to pursue an unconventional career leap. Your enthusiasm transforms mundane tasks into adventures—whether turning a grocery run into a scavenger hunt or rallying friends to fundraise for a cause across continents.",
        "growth_areas": "Your restless energy can lead to scattered focus or avoiding commitments that require depth. For instance, you might abandon a half-finished novel to chase a new hobby, or deflect a partner's request for emotional vulnerability by planning a last-minute trip. Your candid nature, while honest, might unintentionally dismiss others' sensitivities, like joking about a friend's cautious life choices without recognizing their fears.\nTip: Cultivate \"rooted curiosity.\" Before pivoting to a new goal, ask, \"What can I learn by staying here a little longer?\" For tough conversations, practice reflective listening: paraphrase the other person's words before sharing your perspective to show care.",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to anchor your visions. Co-create a project with a Virgo—they'll design step-by-step plans while you infuse big-picture inspiration—like a workshop blending mindfulness hikes with goal-setting strategies.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Launch a platform that merges adventure with insight, such as a YouTube series interviewing indigenous storytellers or a podcast dissecting how ancient philosophies solve modern problems. Your knack for connecting ideas will turn wanderlust into wisdom.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your optimism isn't naivety—it's the torch that illuminates paths others fear to walk. Your freedom isn't rebellion; it's the audacity to live authentically in a world of \"shoulds.\" Explore relentlessly, teach fearlessly, and remember: the world needs your flame to stay curious, courageous, and unapologetically alive."
    },
    
    "Capricorn": {
        "traits": "Ambitious, Disciplined, Strategic, Resilient, Pragmatic",
        "explanation": "Capricorn Suns are the architects of achievement. Their unwavering discipline and strategic foresight empower them to build lasting legacies, master challenges, and lead with quiet authority. Guided by pragmatism and patience, they thrive in environments where effort and integrity pave the path to success.",
        "innate_talents": "Your Capricorn Sun excels in roles demanding structure and long-term vision.

In daily life, you're the friend who organizes a family reunion with military precision, coaches a colleague through a promotion strategy, or transforms a cluttered garage into a functional home office. Your resilience shines in adversity—whether navigating a corporate merger or helping a sibling rebuild after a setback.",
        "growth_areas": "Your dedication to success can lead to workaholism or rigidity. For example, you might skip vacations to meet self-imposed deadlines, or dismiss a coworker's innovative idea because \"it's not the way things are done.\" Your focus on control might also make it hard to delegate, like micromanaging a team project to ensure perfection.\nTip: Embrace \"strategic pauses.\" Schedule weekly downtime (e.g., a 30-minute walk with no agenda) to recharge. For flexibility, adopt a \"test and learn\" mindset—pilot a new workflow for two weeks before judging it.",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) to blend discipline with spontaneity. Plan a hybrid project with a Sagittarius—they'll brainstorm bold ideas while you map timelines—like a retreat mixing adventure sports with goal-setting workshops.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Mentor emerging talent in your field. Create a step-by-step guide or host office hours sharing your expertise (e.g., \"How to Negotiate Promotions\" or \"Budgeting for Startups\"). Your structured approach will turn your wisdom into actionable tools.",
        "closing_affirmation": "Your ambition isn't cold—it's the quiet engine that turns dreams into reality. Your discipline isn't rigidity; it's the proof that greatness is built one intentional step at a time. Lead with integrity, embrace balance wisely, and remember: the world needs your resolve to stay grounded, visionary, and unshakably strong."

Your ability to think outside the box turns obstacles into opportunities—whether redesigning a nonprofit's outreach strategy or teaching kids coding through gamified lessons.",
        "growth_areas": "Your focus on big-picture ideals can sometimes overlook practical details or emotional nuances. For example, you might draft a groundbreaking proposal for workplace equity but struggle to address a teammate's burnout, or prioritize futuristic goals over a partner's need for present-day connection. Your objectivity might also come across as detached during heartfelt conversations.\nTip: Balance vision with grounding. Before finalizing a project, ask, \"What's one small step I can take today to make this real?\" For interpersonal moments, practice empathy by saying, \"I hear you—how can I support you right now?\"",
        "personal_growth": "Partner with Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to root your ideas in reality. Collaborate with a Virgo to pilot a community project—they'll handle logistics while you focus on visionary goals—ensuring your concepts gain traction without losing their transformative edge.\nProfessional/Creative Development: Launch a digital platform crowdsourcing solutions for global challenges (e.g., an app connecting volunteers with micro-projects or a podcast amplifying grassroots innovators). Your knack for uniting technology and humanity will turn abstract ideas into actionable movements.",

Your adaptability shines in uncertain situations—whether pivoting a project's direction after sudden setbacks or soothing a child's fears with improvised bedtime stories.",
        "growth_areas": "Your sensitivity, while a gift, can lead to absorbing others' stress or escaping into fantasies to avoid harsh realities. For example, you might procrastinate on a tough decision by binge-watching nostalgic shows, or neglect your needs to \"rescue\" someone who hasn't asked for help. Over-idealism might also leave you disillusioned when others don't share your vision.\nTip: Anchor your energy with boundaries. Before taking on someone else's burden, ask, \"Is this mine to carry?\" Pair this with grounding rituals—like morning journaling or a walk near water—to stay connected to your inner voice.",
